<img src="image.png" alt="Exemplo imagem">

> The project is a website which consumes the public Pok√©mon API, listing each one pok√©mon in cards, being possible to access a page with details. It's possible to navigate through pages, and there's a theme-toggler system.

### Description

Users should be able to:

- Scroll through pok√©mon's 10 at a time, according to the Pok√©dex Order;
- See a image, name and pok√©dex ID of the pok√©mon on cards;
- When clicking the "Show more" button, it should load 10 more pok√©mon;
- Change between "Dark" and "Light" themes;
- When clicking any card, navigate to the pok√©mon details page;
- Navigate to prev and next pok√©mon inside of the pok√©mon details page.

### Adjustments and Improvements

The project is still in development, so there's few things that will be corrected, enhanced, and new features are coming by:

- Add a search filter feature;
